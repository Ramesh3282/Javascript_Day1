1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.
